I'm not the kind of person to write happy endings, but that must be a side effect from depression. I know that even as a kid I used to feel the big emptiness left a senseless life.
What was my purpose here on Earth, I didn't, don't and will never know. Hence the void, which is easier to fill with sadness rather than happiness, for one does not require any kind of work. Or as my friends would say, it's a mood.
Well I was a moody bitch for as long as I can remember. Therefore, my stories were sad ones. I have killed more characters than myself in my head, which is kind of indicative of how fucked up I always was. 
However, now, and by now I mean Now, there is not enough sadness left in me to fill the void. That had never happened before.
